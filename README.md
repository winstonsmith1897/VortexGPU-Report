# VortexGPU-Report
In this work we provide a review of the Vortex GPU Project, starting
from the paper “Vortex: Extending the RISC-V ISA for GPGPU and 3DGraphics Research” in which was introduced, and an analysis of the GPU’s
architecture and its specification. Moreover, we also provide an overview
of the insights of the Vortex implementation, which is open-source and
available in the official Github repository.
